# Freecom Full-Stack Tutorial Series

In this repository, you find the code for each chapter of the [Freecom](https://www.graph.cool/freecom/) tutorial series. With every new chapter, we're adding _two_ new folders to the repository that will generally be named as follows:
 
- `freecom-0X`:  Contains the starter code for chapter `X`
- `freecom-0X-final`: Contains the final code for chapter `X` and serves as a reference solution if you get lost along the way 

Note that you'll have to [add your own GraphQL endpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItsQWNPw1U&feature=youtu.be&t=8m8s) in `src/index.js`.
